OVERVIEW
========

XPCW is a graphics and keyboard library for the Amstrad PCW and MESCC,
under the CP/M operating system.

It consists of a CP/M Plus RSX file, with some library files (.h) for MESCC (my
own version of the Small-C compiler).


THE RSX
=======

The RSX is written in Z80 assembler source code.

It can be accessed by any CP/M program or language, provided it follows
its conventions (read the RSX source code for more information).

To generate the RSX, you can do the following steps:

	m80 =xpcw                     <- Compile with M80, to generate XPCW.REL
	link xpcw[op]                 <- Link to generate XPCW.PRL
	erase xpcw.rsx                <- Erase previous XPCW.RSX file if exists
	rename xpcw.prl xpcw.rsx      <- Rename XPCW.PRL to XPCW.RSX

The above steps are only for your information, because the XPCW.RSX file
is already included in the XPCW distribution files.

The XPCW.RSX file, has to be attached to any program that uses this
library:

	gencom myprog.com xpcw.rsx


THE LIBRARIES
=============

Only one MESCC library is needed (xpcw.h), the other are optional.

The libraries are:

	xpcw.h    - Main library.
	xdraw.h   - Functions to draw pixels, lines, etc.
	xtext.h   - Functions to write text, set the font, change attributes, etc.
	xchrdef.h - Functions to get / set character definitions.
	xbitmap.h - Functions to draw bitmaps.
	xkeyb.h   - Functions to access the keyboard.

You can extend the libraries, or create new ones.

See the libraries source code, for more information about the available
functions.


MAKE PROGRAMS THAT USE XPCW
===========================

The XPCW RSX can be called from any CP/M program, written in any programming
language, provided it follows the XPCW conventions (read the RSX source code
for more information).

In this section, you will see how to make a program written in MESCC, that uses
the XPCW libraries.

In your MESCC source code, you must to write the following line, to include
the XPCW.H library:

	#include "xpcw.h"

As the other libraries are optional, you must include only, the libraries
you will use.

For example, if you will use functions to draw pixels, you must to include
the XDRAW.H library:

	#include "xdraw.h"

Once you have compiled your program with MESCC, you must to attach the RSX
file to it.

The full procedure is as follows:

	cc myprog                    <- To generate MYPROG.ZSM
	zsm myprog                   <- To generate MYPROG.HEX
	hexcom myprog                <- To generate MYPROG.COM
	gencom myprog.com xpcw.rsx   <- To attach XPCW.RSX to MYPROG.COM

Then, you can run your program by writing at the CP/M prompt:

	myprog


EXAMPLES
========

As an example, you can see the XDEMO program:

	xdemo.com - Executable
	xdemo.c   - Source code.

My game SQUAREX uses this library too.
